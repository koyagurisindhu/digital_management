Digital project management is the process of planning,
executing and managing digital projects. 
These types of projects use web technologies to deliver digital products,
which typically have a focus on the customer or end user. 
For example, types of digital projects can include websites,
mobile applications, videos or social media campaigns. 
Digital project managers oversee these projects by communicating with clients and stakeholders,
organizing resources, reviewing processes and leading team members to deliver successful project outcomes. 
The goal of digital project management is to complete the project within the expected budget and timeline while maximizing its return on investment.
